<br>
-------
<br>
<p>Riley (HI): Alright, folks, let’s cut to the chase—don’t leave fantasy games on the table! My sources tell me 30% of managers in leagues last season forfeited games due to inactivity, costing them an average of 15 points per week. With roto scoring, every goal, assist, and save counts, especially in tight categories like plus-minus or shutouts. Play those lineups, or you’re handing your rivals a freebie!</p><br>

<p>Gordie (OT): Back in my day, kid, we didn’t have fancy apps to set lineups—we scratched ‘em out on a napkin between shifts! But even then, you played every damn game. I once saw a guy lose a championship ‘cause he skipped a Tuesday tilt—left his goalie on the bench while I snagged a 40-save shutout. Dust off that roster, or you’ll be cryin’ into your beer come playoffs!</p><br>

<p>Vinnie (FM): Are you friggin’ kiddin’ me with this crap?! Leaving games unplayed is a goddamn travesty—pure hockey heresy! You’ve got players out there droppin’ gloves and snipin’ goals, and you’re sittin’ on your ass? Get your lazy butt up and set those lineups, or I’ll come through your screen and shove a stick up your—well, you get it! Every point’s a battle, so fight for it!</p><br>

<p>Larry (RHA): Heh heh, you guys are wound up tighter than my Zamboni’s belt! I once saw a manager leave his lineup blank ‘cause he was too busy flirtin’ with the concession gal—missed a 5-goal night! Me, I’d play every game just to keep the ice smooth—figuratively, ya know? Toss in a random pickup like a wacky mascot goalie—keeps the league laughin’ while you rack up points!</p><br>

<p>Riley (HI): Love the energy, Larry! Seriously, though, data backs this up—active managers who play every game see a 22% higher finish rate in the top half of their leagues. Use those waiver wires, adjust for injuries, and don’t sleep on midweek matchups. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, and every game’s a chance to widen that gap!</p><br>

<p>Gordie (OT): Amen, Riley! I remember pullin’ a double shift in ‘82 just to ice a lineup—beat a rookie by a hair with a last-second assist. These young bucks today got no excuse with all this tech. Play every game, or you’re leavin’ meat on the bone—old hockey proverb, that!</p><br>

<p>Vinnie (FM): Damn straight, Grizzly! No excuses, you slackers—play every freakin’ game or get outta my league! I’ve seen guys cry over a missed 3-point night ‘cause they were too busy watchin’ reruns. Set those lineups, or I’ll scream so loud your cat’ll join the NHL!</p><br>

<p>Larry (RHA): Ha! My cat’s already got better moves than half these managers! Last week, I threw a rubber puck on the ice mid-game to wake ‘em up—worked, they scored! Play every match, folks, or I’ll start drivin’ the Zamboni over your fantasy dreams—vroom vroom!</p><br>
<br><br>
<p>There you have it, folks—the gang’s all in on playing every fantasy hockey game! Stay tuned for more unhinged takes as the season heats up. Don’t leave points on the table—get out there and dominate!</p><br>
