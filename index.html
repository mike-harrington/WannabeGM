<h1><b><u>DRAFT DAY:</u></b></h1>
TBD (assuming we do have a live in-person draft when the 2020-21 season restarts in December sometime)<br>
<b>OWN the music!<br></b>
<br>
how this goes:<br>
Top seeds (and hosts) will have control of what our auditory experience will be for an hour at a time.<br>
<br>
If you have this power and choose to hand it off, your call. you decide to delegate as you wish. Those chosen by the music man during his time must do the musics!<br>
Those winners that aren't in attendance can choose delegate any or all parts of their hour to anyone at the live event. If we hear nothing, the hour is automatically transfered to... the host!<br>
**Commissioner will be responsible for background music during the draft<br>
<br>
Starting at ?<br>
1st - a-bpm (Harrington)<br>
2nd - b-cpm (Blakely)<br>
3rd c-dpm (Duggan)<br>
Host d-epm (TBD)<br>
4th e-fpm (Maran)<br>
5th f-gpm (Mulvihill)<br>

Now, to make things a bit more interesting, GMs finishing 6th to 10th get 1 request and 1 veto card for the night. Request any song, during any timeframe and veto any song that <br>happens to be making your ears bleed.. but remember.. choose wisely.. you only have one of each!! (6th- Kevin; 7th- Patrick; 8th- Symmington; 9th- Duncan; 10th- Egan)<br> **again for those not attending, just let us know who you would like to give your R/V cards to, and if I hear nothing.. I shall hand them out to those with the best 'Dugganhatten' I hear.<br>
<br>
GMs 11th to 13th.. .. .. Do better!! hahahahaha (gots to promote action biatches!!)<br>
